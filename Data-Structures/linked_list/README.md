# Data Structures - Linked Lists

**Author**: Stephen Koch
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
In this file of the data structures, linked lists are created and tested.

A linked list is a reference to a sequence of 'Nodes'. A singly linked list has single references to other Nodes. Each Node is connected to another in the singly list, starting at the first or 'head' node and linking to the next node and then the next node until a referenced node is reached that has no next value linking it to any other nodes.

## Getting Started
Running tests is straight forward and involves using pytest.

First, make sure that you have python3 installed:
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.5
```
If you do not:
```
$ brew install python
```
You need to have the files locally. Click on the green clone or download button and Download ZIP:

In your command line, navigate to this directory:
```
$ cd ~  ##this is your root directory
$ cd Downloads  ##by default: Downloads is a directory inside of your root; and where your file will be downloaded
$ cd python_data_structures_and_algorithims ##and now you are in this directory
```
This module is running tests on given data imputs. Install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) to get started:
Installing pytest:
```
$ pip install -U pytest
```
Running tests:
```
$ pytest
```
