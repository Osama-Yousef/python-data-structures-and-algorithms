##### Code Challenge One - Array_Reverse
Problem domain:
    Write a function that takes in a list and prints a new list in the reverse order
Visual:
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]    
#### Challenge
Algorithm:
    1. Define a function that accepts one list
    2. Create an empty list
    3. Assign the empty list to a sliced input list using step -1
    4. Print the new list
#### Approach & Efficiency
For this challenge I worked with Ting Luo. We set out to write a simple function (d.r.y) that matched the algorithm we determined beforehand. It appears that this algorithm would be O(N) performance.
