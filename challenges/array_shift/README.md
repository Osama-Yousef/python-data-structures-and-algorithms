### Code Challenge Two - Array_Shift
Problem domain:
    Write a function that adds a given number to the middle of a provided list
Visual:
    inputs: [2, 4, 6, 8] and 5 -> output: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8]   
#### Challenge
Algorithm:
    1. Define a function that accepts two arguements(list, integer)
    2. Finds the middle of the list
    3. Appends the first half of the list, integer in the middle, and last half of the list to a new list
    4. Returns the new list
#### Approach & Efficiency
For this challenge I worked with Chris. We set out to write a simple function (d.r.y) that matched the algorithm we determined beforehand. It appears that this algorithm would be O(N) performance.
