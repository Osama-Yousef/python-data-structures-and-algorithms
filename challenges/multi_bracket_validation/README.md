# Challenge - Multiple Bracket Validation

**Author**: Stephen Koch
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
In this module, we are writing a function that, when given a string, can determine wither or not brackets are being opened and closed at the proper places. The function returns True or False based on correct bracket usage.

Example:
```
Input string: (){}[]
Output: True
```
```
Input string: ({[hello_world]}){}
Output: True
```
```
Input string: ({)}[]
Output: False
```

## Getting Started
Running tests is straight forward and involves using pytest.

First, make sure that you have python3 installed:
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.5
```
If you do not:
```
$ brew install python
```
You need to have the files locally. Click on the green clone or download button and Download ZIP:

Navigate to your command line:
```
MacOS: Press command + space to open up the search feature
Search for "terminal" - This is your default command line on MacOS.
```
In your command line, navigate to this directory:
```
$ cd ~  ##this is your root directory
$ cd Downloads  ##by default: Downloads is a directory inside of your root; and where your file will be downloaded
$ cd python_data_structures_and_algorithims ##and now you are in this directory
```
This module is running tests on given data imputs. Install [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) to get started:
Installing pytest:
```
$ pip install -U pytest
```
Running tests:
```
$ pytest
```
